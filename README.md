## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
Business applications are constructed utilizing software components called as services under service-oriented architecture, or SOA. Services can communicate with each other in a variety of languages and platforms and provide a range of business operations.    
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
-Standardize service control: The standard helps the user use the service. It is essential that service users are able to access these specifications. Portals for discovery, like MuleSoft Exchange Anypoint Platform or MuleSoft API Community Manager, offer a comprehensive method for documenting and sharing the requirements and capabilities for service usage.

-Loose Coupling: One of the key benefits of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is the flexibility it offers customers when dealing with providers that support them through services. A ticketing system and a client app are put in opposition to each other by a service, which breaks their dependency and disconnects them. 

-Reusability: Reusability generates a flywheel that fosters innovation. Assist groups in locating current services before creating new ones. Encouraging the adoption of reusability requires informing customers about what is presently available. To address this specific need, MuleSoft Exchange and API Community Manager offer state-of-the-art solutions.   
3. Define Microservices.
Software created with the microservices architectural and organizational framework consists of independent, separate services that communicate with one another through well-defined application programming interfaces. These services are owned by small, autonomous teams.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
Microservices are an approach to building applications consisting of multiple small, independent services.
Microservices in Java refer to a software architecture pattern where an application is built as a collection of small, independent services.
Enterprises like Amazon, Netflix, Uber, and Etsy have adopted microservices to achieve scaling advantages, business agility, and profitability.
Microservices offer benefits such as agility, pluggability, scalability, and the ability to adapt to changing business requirements.

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
In an SOA model, services or modules are shared and reused enterprise-wide, whereas a microservice architecture is built on individual services that function independently. In other words, SOA has an enterprise scope, while microservices has an application scope.
